Beginning with JDK 8, the classes called Optional, OptionalDouble, OptionalInt, and
OptionalLong offer a way to handle situations in which a value may or may not be present.
In the past, you would normally use the value null to indicate that no value is present.
However, this can lead to null pointer exceptions if an attempt is made to dereference a null
reference. As a result, frequent checks for a null value were necessary to avoid generating an
exception. These classes provide a better way to handle such situations.

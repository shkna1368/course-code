Stream Basics
Letâ€™s begin by defining the term stream as it applies to the stream API: a stream is a conduit
for data. Thus, a stream represents a sequence of objects. A stream operates on a data
source, such as an array or a collection. A stream, itself, never provides storage for the data.
It simply moves data, possibly filtering, sorting, or otherwise operating on that data in the
process. As a general rule, however, a stream operation by itself does not modify the data
source. For example, sorting a stream does not change the order of the source. Rather,
sorting a stream results in the creation of a new stream that produces the sorted result.

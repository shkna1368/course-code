 Inversion of Control (IoC) is a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them. This object delegates the job of constructing such dependencies to an IoC container.

In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

public class Person {
    private Animal animal;
 
    public Person(Animal animal) {
        this.animal = animal;
    }
 
    // getter, setter
}


-----------

Animal animal = new Animal("fuffy", 5);
Person person = new Person(animal);

----------------------------------------

@Component
public class Person {
    
    @Autowired
    private Animal animal;
    
    // ...
}
-------------------

@Configuration
public class Config {
    @Bean
    public Animal getAnimal() {
        return new Animal("Fuffy", 5);
    }
}

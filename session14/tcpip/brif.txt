Internet Protocol (IP) is a low-level
routing protocol that breaks data into small packets and sends them to an address across a
network, which does not guarantee to deliver said packets to the destination. Transmission
Control Protocol (TCP) is a higher-level protocol that manages to robustly string together
these packets, sorting and retransmitting them as necessary to reliably transmit data.
A third protocol, User Datagram Protocol (UDP), sits next to TCP and can be used directly
to support fast, connectionless, unreliable transport of packets.
